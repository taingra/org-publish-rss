#+TITLE: Org Publish Auto RSS

Quickly add RSS feeds to org-publish projects.

This works similar to the :auto-sitemap publishing option.

* Setup
To use org-publish-auto-rss.el you must add the configuration options
to your org-publish-project-alist settings.  The minimum required
options are:

- :auto-rss :: (t/nil) Enables RSS feed generation.

- :rss-title :: Channel title of the RSS feed.  If blank will fall
  back to :sitemap-title.

- :rss-description :: Channel description of the RSS feed.

- :rss-link :: The URL to the website corresponding to the RSS
  channel.  Will use :html-link-up if blank.

For complete list of options see the Commentary section of
[[file:org-publish-auto-rss.el]].

** Example Project
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-publish-project-alist
	'(("blog"
	   :base-directory "~/Documents/org/website/"
	   :base-extension "org"
	   :publishing-directory "~/public_html/"
	   :publishing-function  org-html-publish-to-html

	   :auto-rss t
	   :rss-title "Example Posts"
	   :rss-description "My example website."
	   :rss-link "https://example.com"

	   :completion-function org-publish-auto-rss
	  ("static"
	   :base-directory "~/Documents/org/website/"
	   :base-extension "css\\|jpg\\|png\||gif"
	   :include ("rss.xml")
	   :publishing-directory "~/public_html/"
	   :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)
	  ("example.com" :components ("blog" "static"))))
#+end_src

** Running

M-x org-publish-auto-rss [RET] PROJECT

You may get a cache error, retry this after recently publishing the
corresponding project.

** Run Automatically when Publishing

You can run this automatically by adding org-publish-auto-rss as a
:completion-function which will run after any publishing action for
that project.  This is the final publishing step so uploading the RSS
file will need to be handled by a separate project, see example project.

* Why not use ox-rss.el?
Using an org exporter adds an additional export steps and
configuration that is unnecessary for a basic org-publish project.

Org project --> Generate Org sitemap --> Export sitemap to RSS

Org project --> RSS feed

The clever [[https://writepermission.com/org-blogging-rss-feed.html][ox-rss.el solution provided by Toon Claes]] definitely works
is an alternate to this package.  However it requires a lot of setup
that I was trying to avoid.

* Outstanding Development Goals

** TODO Optionally generate GUID tags
** TODO Add global customization variables
** TODO Add ability to export with full HTML post content
